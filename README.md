 Networking Demonstration in Godot 4 C#

This project is created with Godot 4 Beta 9 C#

- It demonstrates the use of the new NetworkSynchronizer, Networkspawner nodes
- simple Terrain generation with Tilemap, Noise, Meshinstance2D
- Simple Character Controller with the ability to place new blocks (synchronized on network)

What is missing:
- Map saving and map synchronizing if clients manipulate them before other clients join
